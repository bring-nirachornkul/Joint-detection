# Joint-detection

This project is used mediapipe to detect all the joints on the body, as well as using OpenCV2 to display the outcome.


This code is from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06TE_U21FK4">Nicholas Renotte</a>.
This project is created to learn how to use opencv2 to detect the joint's angle in the body.
